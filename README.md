# Hiding Shellcode in Image Files with Python and C/C++
**-> A project that demonstrates embedding shellcode payloads into image files (like PNGs) using Python and extracting them using C/C++. Payloads can be retrieved directly from the file on disk or from the image stored in a binary's resources section (.rsrc)**

### Code of this Project
- [payload-embedder.py](https://github.com/andrecrafts/hide-payload-in-images/blob/main/code/payload-embedder.py)
  - Append shellcode payloads to the end of an image file.
- [payload-extractor-from-file.cpp](https://github.com/andrecrafts/hide-payload-in-images/blob/main/code/payload-extractor/payload-extractor-from-file/payload-extractor-from-file.cpp)
  - Extract payloads from modified image files stored on disk.
- [payload-extractor-from-resource.cpp](https://github.com/andrecrafts/hide-payload-in-images/blob/main/code/payload-extractor/payload-extractor-from-rsrc/payload-extractor-from-rsrc.cpp)
  - Extracts payloads from image files stored in the binary's resources section (.rsrc) using WinAPI functions like `FindResource` and `LockResource`. 
- **(NEW)** [payload-extractor-from-resource-via-peb.cpp](https://github.com/andrecrafts/hide-payload-in-images/blob/main/code/payload-extractor/payload-extractor-from-rsrc-via-peb/payload-extractor-from-rsrc-via-peb.cpp)
  - Extracts payloads from image files stored in the binary's resources section by manually parsing the Process Environment Block (PEB) and PE headers, **avoiding WinAPI functions for increased stealth**. 

#### ‚ùó Updates ‚ùó
1. **Stealthier Payload Extraction:** Implemented manual PE header parsing to retrieve resources without WinAPI calls, avoiding detection vectors.
2. **PEB Reliability Fix:** Replaced function `hGetCurrentModuleHandle`'s unsafe backward header parsing with direct PEB access via __readgsqword/__readfsdword, resolving compiler-optimization crashes and supporting x86/x64. This new function has two alternatives, based on whether the project is a DLL or a EXE.
3. **PEB Structure Support:** Added `PEB_Structs.h` for portable PEB/PE definitions, eliminating dependencies on Windows headers.
